I used the api swapi which is the api for star wars. My search was for data based on Leia Organa.
```python
#To use swapi you must type the following command in your Terminal:
pip install swapi
```

There is also no api key needed to use it.

This code stores data from the swapi api in a csv and data found when searching Leia Organa in europeana in a seperate csv
