# Exploring the Age of the top ranked novels #

For this assignment I used different graphs and filtering methods to display the age of the novels in the goodreads dataset.

The dataset is included locally in the pandas-eda folder under the name "novels.csv".

To use the notebook you must have pandas, altair, and matplotlib installed.

To install each of these:
pip install pandas
pip install "altair[all]"
pip install matplotlib

Remember to activate your virtual environment.
